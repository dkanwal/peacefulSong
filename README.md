# peacefulSong
Code written in Sonic Pi that produces a peaceful and origional song. The song is subject to small changes from play to play through the code.

I wrote this code by first composing a song on the piano, then translating it into code. The song utilizes the C major pentatonic chords, and a unique note progression. The song is designed to be a calm melody that shifts with different timing patterns and frequencies to take the listener on a calm or even nostalgic journey. I hope the user is able to connect with the swinging shifts in the 
music and find that the shifts in the melody are similar to those in their immediate task, current week, or even their past year.

When I initially was assigned this project, I was fascinated with the idea of writing a relaxing melody and translating it into code. I found it was very difficult to translate the music directly becuase I ran out of possible characters and there were limited uses for loops becuase of how the melody changes progressively. However the ending sequence uses a nice loop that is similar to a 'repeat' sign in sheet music, and to add some creative elements, the synths are probabalistically chosen so the song has a few different endings (which is not translatable to a single piece of sheet music).
